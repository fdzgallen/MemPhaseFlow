Code to simulate the temporal evolution of a biological membrane inside a fluid flow.

This is the code used in the peer-review article "Red Blood Cells in low Reynolds number flow: a vorticity-basedcharacterization of shapes in two dimensions" accepted for publication in the Soft Matter Journal. It is uploaded here for transparency and to make the use or implementation of our model easier for any person interested.

Straightfoward and simple application using a stream function formulation to solve the fluid flow. This way the incompressibility of the fluid is mantained for

Modifying the code as explained in the article you can simulate multiple flows: Poiseuille, Couette, temporal-dependent etc. Here we will provide a few versions of the code so you can simulate different systems without issue, but playing with the code to explore new possibilities is encouraged.
