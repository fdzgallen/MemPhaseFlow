# MembraneFlow2D
Code to simulate the temporal evolution of a biological membrane inside a fluid flow.

This is the code used in the peer-review article "Red Blood Cells in low Reynolds number flow: a vorticity-basedcharacterization of shapes in two dimensions" accepted for publication in the Soft Matter Journal.

Straightfoward and simple application using a stream function formulation.

Modifying the code as explained in the article you can simulate multiple flows: Poiseuille, Couette, temporal-dependent etc. Here we will provide a few versions of the code so you can simulate different systems without issue, but playing with the code to explore new possibilities is encouraged.
